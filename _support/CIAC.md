The Chinese Information and Advice Centre (CIAC) is a registered charity (Reg No. 800646). CIAC offers free information, advice and support to disadvantaged Chinese people living in the United Kingdom.

The Centre has over 30 years of history supporting Chinese people whose accessibility to mainstream services are often limited by language and/or cultural barriers. Based in Westminster, we continue to provide assistance to our beneficiaries from all over London. A smaller proportion of them come from other areas of the UK. We are committed to upholding our ethos of anti-racism, anti-sexism and ensuring equal opportunities.

We represent and advocate for the Chinese community on issues, both personal and political, in which they have vested interests in. Through the years, we have led numerous social and consultative initiatives that make a difference to the lives of the members of our local community.

CIAC is also actively engaged in campaigning against the high number of gaming establishments in and around the areas of London Chinatown and Soho. Other campaigns that we are involved in include anti-human trafficking campaigns, that hinge on matters such as modern slavery and prostitution.
