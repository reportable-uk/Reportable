The Chinese Association of Tower Hamlets (CATH), established in 1983, aims at providing assistance and support to disadvantaged people of Chinese origin. It was set up by a group of energetic college and high school students who identified a community need and started off as part-time volunteers in a tiny donated space in Tower Hamlets. The early focus was on helping non-English speaking elderly in the homework help Spanish write my research paper online community. Later, CATH broadened its scope and provided adult and youth employment programmes, English for Speakers of Other Languages (ESOL) and Chinese Mother Tongue classes, family and youth services, as well as a community care service. Our mission statement is Bridging cultures, communities and generations, creating opportunities for people of Chinese origin and their families to succeed".

CATH is a company limited by guarantee established for charitable purposes only. Our current activities include the ongoing operation of the Opportunity Centre, providing career and education support through information provision, training, simulation and personal counselling; our Chinese school which provides Chinese language classes for children and English classes for adults‚ with the aim of improving cross-generational communication; our Home Care service which provides culturally sensitive and high quality services to elderly people; our Youth Club and Elderly Luncheon Club.
