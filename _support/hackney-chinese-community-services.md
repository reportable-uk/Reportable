Local Chinese residents founded Hackney Chinese Community Services in 1985 to help meet specific needs and support the welfare of the local community. In 1986 that the London Borough of Hackney agreed to let HCCS. use one of its shop front premises. With a start up grant, Hackney Chinese Community Services first opened its doors at 15 Pearson Street in September and a revenue grant enabled us to recruit one full-time community organiser. Funded by the Inner London Education Authority our Chinese School opened its doors the following year.

HCCS was first registered as a charity and became a limited company in 1988. In October 1990 that we moved to our present address in Ellingfort Road. Today, we have a hall which can accommodate up to a hundred people, a common room with library, a confidential advisory room, 2 offices, store room, counselling room and a kitchen fitting with traditional Chinese cooking facilities. At our centre we provide a number of services for our local community including Hackney Chinese School, Elderly Luncheon Club, Chinese Advocate, Health Outreach, Mental Health, Youth Club, Carer, Singing and Dancing.

We worked closely with the Vietnamese community organisation An Viet Foundation for several years. When the charity folded in 2017, we expanded our remit to include and continue services to the Vietnamese and Chinese community.
