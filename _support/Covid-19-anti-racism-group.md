CARG, initiated by concerned citizens, addresses the increase in racism and hate crime towards British East Asians (i.e. Chinese, East and Southeast Asian) and international students arising from the Covid-19 pandemic. Although CARG's primary focus is British East Asian, we stand in solidarity with all other communities affected by Covid-19 related racism.

Depending on different situations, CARG will collaborate with other anti-racism groups and those representing other ethnic communities. When the pandemic is over, CARG will either disband or evolve to tackle systemic racism in the longer term.

CARG aims to:
- Challenge misinformed articles, inflammatory words and misleading narratives in the media and public discourse that incite Sinophobia and racism
- Call out racism towards British East Asian people and international students in the media with formal complaints as they happen
- Advocate and promote positive stories of British East Asian contributions to British society in the public sphere
- Develop a register of supporters and a pool of experts and professionals that CARG can rely on for help
