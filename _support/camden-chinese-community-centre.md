Camden Chinese Community Centre was established in 1981. We are a thriving Camden-based organisation that provides services of the highest quality primarily for members of the Chinese community irrespective of age or gender, but not exclusively to those of Chinese origin. We provide socially inclusive services that improve the conditions of life for inhabitants of Camden and people of surrounding boroughs who need support owing to age, disability, poverty, social and financial circumstances, and educate through the study of Chinese arts, culture and history.

We aim to provide such services through a mixture of centre-based social welfare, recreational and leisure activities, outreach work, and collaborative work with our partners and the wider community.

We currently have over 1100 members.
