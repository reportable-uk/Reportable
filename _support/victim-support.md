Victim Support is an independent charity. We are dedicated to supporting people affected by crime and traumatic incidents in England and Wales, and we put them at the heart of our organisation. Our support and campaigns are informed and shaped by them and their experiences.

We provide specialist services to help people cope and recover and to empower them to ensure their voices are heard individually and collectively at a local and national level.
