Haringey Chinese Community Centre was established in 1987, and expanded its objectives and became the Haringey Chinese Centre.

HCC has been at the heart of the Chinese community since its inception and continues to be committed to promoting social, education and cultural welfare of the Chinese people by maintaining a stable and efficient support framework as its contribution to a fairer and more equitable society.

HCC focuses on providing timely, appropriate cultural advice, advocacy, and social care / support to help improve its members' position in multicultural Britain and to improve their quality of life.
