CATCH is a group of charities working to end hate crime. We're here to give specialist advice and help to people targeted with violence, abuse or harassment because of their race, religion, disability, sexuality or gender identity.

CATCH is open to anyone experiencing hate in London. If you experienced a hate crime elsewhere, you can still get in touch.
