besea.n is a non-profit, grassroots organisation founded by six East and South East Asian (ESEA) women, whose mission is to promote positive representation of ESEA people in the UK and tackle discrimination at all levels in our society.

ESEA folk are underrepresented in the British media, on screen, in creative spaces and in corporate and institutional positions of power. Much of our current media representation is negative or centres around the social construct of race, drawing on clichéd tropes that often denigrate, fetishise or Orientalise the subjects. ESEAs are regularly left out of public discourse around Asians in Britain, and the diverse demographics are poorly defined, usually relegated to the dreaded ‘BAME’ moniker or perhaps even ‘Asian - Other’.

Enter besea.n.
