## 法律定義

當受害者或其它人認為加害者是出於對受害人的殘疾、種族、宗教信仰、性取向或是跨性別者身分的敵意或歧視而進行犯罪時，此類犯罪行為就構成仇恨犯罪。

需要注意的是，只要加害人主觀認定受害人有某一特徵並且對此特徵抱有敵意或歧視，更進一步實施犯罪行為，那麼這一行為就構成仇恨犯罪，受害者並不需要真的擁有這一特徵。

## 仇恨犯罪與一般犯罪的區別

仇恨犯罪的形式有很多種：例如威脅、人身攻擊、破壞財產、騷擾/霸凌和其它的犯罪行為。

仇恨犯罪可能在任場所裡、任何情境下發生：比如面對面、文字、線上或社交媒體。

仇恨犯罪是當加害人受對被害人的殘疾、種族、性取向和/或跨性別的敵視或歧視所驅使而進行的犯罪。

## 仇恨犯罪的例子

A hate incident is any incident which the victim, or anyone else, thinks is based on someone’s prejudice towards them because of their race, religion, sexual orientation, disability or because they are transgender. In short, in a hate incident, the actions involved in the incident is not currently a criminal offence under the UK law.

Whether it is a hate crime/hate incident, the victim should always be encouraged to make a report. The police strongly encourage the report of BOTH hate crime AND hate incidents.


## Case studies
Below we have provided a number of case studies to help work through incidents you or community members may encounter. Please read through them and think about whether one of the following has occurred:

1. Hate crime
2. Hate incident
3. General crime
4. None of the above

### Case Study 1

>  “Due to a disability I walk with a cane. I was on my way to the shopping mall when a group of young people started following me. They laughed and pretended to walk with a cane. Then they kicked my walking cane. I fell down and they ran away.”

The group of people has caused physical harm to the person, which constitutes a criminal offence. This is clearly motivated by the hostility towards the person’s disability. This is a typical example of a hate crime.

### Case Study 2

> "My next-door neighbour is very noisy. He plays loud music late at night. When I asked him to turn down the music after 10 p.m. because I must wake up early for my work, he yelled offensive things at me. The next day I found offensive graffiti on my car”

Graffiti on cars could constitute criminal damage). The verbal abuse involved could also constitute a criminal offence depending on the circumstances. If the offensive things yelled and the content of the graffiti show hostility or prejudice towards the person’s characteristics, it would involve a hate element and therefore be a hate crime/incident. From the limited information provided, it is difficult to determine the exact nature of the incidents.

### Case Study 3

>  “Somebody posted a tweet on twitter that said transgender women are all disgusting and shouldn’t be allowed in public”

In this case the hate element would be the hostility and prejudice against transgender women.  Under the current law, using threatening words or behaviour, or displaying any written material which is threatening, is guilty of an offence if the person intends  to stir up hatred on the grounds of sexual orientation.  However, this provision currently does not cover transgender identity. Regardless of the exact legal nature of this act, it constitutes a hate incident.

### Case Study 4

> “Somebody handed out flyers in the town centre saying that Chinese people are all to blame for Coronavirus and that Chinese people in England need to be punished with violence”

The message displayed can be seen as expressing a prejudice and hostility towards Chinese people, and therefore can be considered as a hate element. The act itself may amount to a criminal offence ‘displaying to another person any writing, sign or other visible representation which is threatening, abusive or insulting. 	However, it ultimately depends on the specific facts of the case and the eventual prosecution outcome.

### Summary

The purpose of the case studies shown above is to illustrate that there is a fine line between hate crimes , hate incidents and other general crime. It can be incredibly difficult to distinguish one from another. The police strongly encourage the report of BOTH hate crime and hate incidents. The victim should never be required to work out the nature of the event before to be “eligible” to make a report. When making a report, the victim should mention that hate is involved if they subjectively experienced so.
