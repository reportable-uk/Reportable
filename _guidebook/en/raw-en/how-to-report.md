### Common considerations with reporting

#### The victim does not want to speak with the police, or is afraid of retaliation from the perpetrator

It’s okay to feel worried or uncertain about what will happen after reporting. You can tell victims that the police deal with these sorts of cases every day, will treat everybody fairly and equally, and will put your safety first. Alternatively, there are ways to make the report without needing to interact with the police or be identified, such as through third party reporting centres, or reporting anonymously (detailed below).  

#### The victim is not comfortable with speaking in English

If the victim is not comfortable with speaking English, this may deter them from reporting the incident. You can help victims to report the crime by calling the police for them or accompanying them to the police station.The police may also be able to provide an interpreter. You should advise the victim to request one to overcome any language barrier.

#### The victim does not want to speak with the police

If the victim is not comfortable speaking with the police, or would prefer to remain anonymous, there are ways to make the report without needing to interact with the police or be identified (see above):
- If your community centre is a third party reporting centre, then you can submit a report on their behalf.
- Alternatively, reports can be submitted anonymously via CrimeReport or TrueVision.

#### The victim is not comfortable being a witness or testifying in court

Some witnesses who feel intimidated or vulnerable, because they are young or disabled for example, and may need help giving evidence. In these cases, witnesses may be entitled to ‘special measures’. This could involve placing a screen between the witness box and the defendant or giving evidence with the help of a specialist.

​For more details on your rights as a witness and the trial process, please refer to Victim Support at https://www.victimsupport.org.uk/going-court/your-rights-witness

#### The victim does not think the incident is serious enough or is worth reporting

The police strongly encourage the report of BOTH hate crime AND hate incidents. It is important to the whole community that it is acknowledged and reported.

Every report builds up a picture of what is really going on in your local area, showing patterns of behaviour against a certain group or by particular individuals. Reporting of the issue can:
- Help police adjust plans like where, when and how they deploy resources.
- Help local agencies like the police and councils understand the issue, so that they can educate, inform and protect everyone in the area.
- Build a more accurate statistical picture of the issue and inform prosecutors, legislators and raise awareness with the general public.

Even if you think your report might not lead to any immediate substantive results, it will benefit the wider community.

## What are the ways to report and why you should consider different ways

### 1. Online reporting

#### What is this solution:
All hate crimes and incidents can be reported online using the **True Vision** platform (https://www.report-it.org.uk/your_police_force), which typically takes 10-20 minutes to complete/

#### Why/when to choose this solution:
- Reporting online is the easiest and most effective way to capture information, and should be prioritised where convenient
- The case will be dealt with by police professionals experienced with handling hate crimes and incidents
- Note that reports can be submitted anonymously

**Do not report online if:**
- The offender is still present​
- You or anyone else is seriously hurt or in danger
- You think the offender may return

### 2. Call the Police

#### What is this solution:
Reporting a crime over the phone directly to the police

- **Call 999 if the crime is in progress or if someone is in immediate danger.**
- Call 101 if the crime isn’t an emergency.

#### Why/when to choose this solution
Choose this solution if you would prefer to speak to someone over the phone, if the crime is in progress or if someone is in immediate danger.

### 3. Visit local police station

#### What is this solution:
Reporting by visiting your local police station. Details on how to contact your local police force can be found at www.police.uk

#### Why/when to choose this solution:
- Report in-person if you have a local police contact, or if the crime is in progress or if someone is in immediate danger
- Note that in cases with no immediate threat or emergency, reporting in person may result in long waiting times

### 4. Report it directly with British Transport Police

#### What is this solution:
- Reporting incidents on public transport directly to the British Transport Police
  - ​Report by text: send message to 61016 to report a crime or incident
  - Report online: http://www.btp.police.uk/contact_us/report_a_crime.aspx

#### Why/when to choose this solution:
- Report through this channel if the hate crime or incident happened on public transport, such as buses, trams, trains, and the underground.
- Note that you can still report crimes that happened  on public transport to the police. After receiving your report, the police will then forward your case to the British Transport. Therefore, reporting to the British Police Transport directly may help to speed up the process.

### 5. Third Party Reporting Centres

#### What is this solution:
A wide range of agencies are able to report hate crimes and incidents on the victims’ behalf and provide them with advice and support.

Examples include:
- Citizens Advice Bureau
- Stop Hate UK: provides confidential and independent reporting service in various areas in the UK, including a 24 - hour helpline.
- Community Voluntary Services

#### Why/when to choose this solution:
Use third-party reporting centres if the victim is uncomfortable speaking directly to the police, or would like to seek support tailored to their community (e.g.Tell MAMA for victims of Islamophobia, GALOP for victims of LGBTQ+ hate).

These organisations may also allow you to report anonymously.

### 6. Report Anonymously through Crimestoppers

- The person will not have to give his/her name
- Everything said will remain confidential
- The victim will never have to appear in court

### 7. Social Media

## How can the victim prepare for reporting

### Before reporting

-  ​​Record details and keep evidence (Photos, videos or audio) of the incident .
- Write down all the details of the incident as soon as you can including descriptions of the perpetrator(s), clothes they wore, any distinguishing marks, any nearby vehicles or witnesses, and anything they said such as homophobic/transphobic abuse or threats they made.
- Any physical evidence that the perpetrator has left behind
- Take photographs of any damage to property or your belongings, such as graffiti, or damage to your car.
- If there are any witnesses, ask them for their contact details and ask them to write down what they saw, sign and date it, as soon as possible.
- Keep any evidence safe, such as clothing, photographs and letters/notes. If the perpetrator may have left fingerprints somewhere, do not touch the area, let the police know.
