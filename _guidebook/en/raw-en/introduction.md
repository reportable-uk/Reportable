## Purpose of the manual

This guidebook is intended as a one-stop guide to identifying and reporting hate crimes and hate crimes on behalf of your community and yourself.

This has become particularly pressing as there has been a large rise in hate crime over recent years, with a significant proportion that goes unreported:

- Almost three-quarters of people of East and Southeast Asian descent have experienced being called a racial slur[^1]
- 300% increase in hate crimes towards people of East and Southeast Asian heritage in the UK since the coronavirus crisis began[^2]
- 900% increase in online hate speech towards China since the coronavirus crisis began[^3]
