We are a group of East Asian volunteers with a strong interest in tackling the rising volumes of hate crime directed at East and South East Asian citizens in the UK, which has risen three-fold since the coronavirus outbreak.

<br>

We believe that by providing simple, accessible information to front-line East and South East Asian community workers, we can best increase reporting and awareness of hate crime and ensure support is available for those in need.
